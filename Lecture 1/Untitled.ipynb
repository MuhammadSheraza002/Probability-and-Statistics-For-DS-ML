    "\r\n",

    "## Notation for Sample Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation for sample spaces depends on the context. In finite sample spaces, we can explicitly list all outcomes. For infinite sample spaces, we may use mathematical notation or describe the characteristics of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Sample Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the sample space is crucial for calculating probabilities. The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space.\n",

    "# Probability Lecture: Addition Rule I\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Good day, students! Today, we delve into a fundamental concept in probability theory, known as the **Addition Rule I**. This rule is particularly useful when dealing with events that are mutually exclusive or disjoint. Let's break down the **Addition Rule I** and understand how it works.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Understanding Mutually Exclusive Events\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Firstly, let's define what we mean by mutually exclusive or disjoint events. Two events, A and B, are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. In simpler terms, the occurrence of one event means the other cannot happen simultaneously.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Addition Rule I Formula\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The **Addition Rule I** provides us with a straightforward formula for calculating the probability of the union of two mutually exclusive events, A and B. The formula is as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Alternatively, you might also encounter the notation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The key point here is that when events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of either event occurring is simply the sum of the individual probabilities.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Example\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's consider a practical example to illustrate the concept. Suppose we have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Event A is drawing an Ace, and Event B is drawing a King. These events are mutually exclusive because a card cannot be both an Ace and a King simultaneously.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, let's apply the **Addition Rule I**:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(\\text{Ace or King}) = P(\\text{Ace}) + P(\\text{King}) \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Since there are 4 Aces in a deck and 4 Kings, we can calculate:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(\\text{Ace or King}) = \\frac{4}{52} + \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{8}{52} \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Simplifying, we get:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[ P(\\ng}) = \\frac{2}{13} \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Conclusion\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In conclusion, the **Addition Rule I** is a powerful tool when dealing with mutually exclusive events. By understanding that the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities, we can make calculations more efficiently.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As you progress in probability theory, you'll encounter variations of this rule and its application in different scenarios. For now, practice applying the **Addition Rule I** with varioou for your attention, and happy calculating!\r\n"
